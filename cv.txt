Hello Sir/Mam.

I'm Rishabh Lawaniya, I currently live in Ghaziabad and was brought up in Bharatpur, Rajasthan.

Currently, I'm pursuing B.Tech. from KIET Group Of institutions and my previous qualification is in 12th Science in the year 2021.

Talking about my hobbies, I love reading books and doing photography, especially street photography because we get to see and talk to strangers and know stories from their lives and capture them.

Talking about my strength and skills, I'm a good listener and I have a deep understanding of human psychology and behaviour. Also, I can maintain a clean and neat and friendly work environment.
